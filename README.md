# StackOverflow Error Search
This program runs your program and automatically searches up your error on StackOverflow. It opens up the first 3 results on the browser.  
## Requirements
You would need to install requests by typing in the terminal:  
```bash 
$ pip install requests
```
## Running
You would first have to change the path of the file you want to run. Use the constant variable at the top of the code.  
You can run the code using
```bash
$ python autoerror.py
```
## Future Steps
Adding better documentation for the code.
